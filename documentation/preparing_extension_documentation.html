				In this tutorial we are going to prepare extension, so AdvancedNMotd would be able to see it.<br/><br/>
				Firstly, you need to create a project and add <span class="code-part">AdvancedNMotd.jar</span> as a library. I will not be leaving any comments here, because these are common actions that you should know.<br/><br/>
				Secondly, create main class and extend from <span class="code-part">AdvancedNMotdExtension</span> class. This class is abstract, with the only abstract method <span class="code-part">onExtensionEnable</span>. This means you must override it. You may not override <span class="code-part">onExtensionDisable</span> method. As can be guessed from names method <span class="code-part">onExtensionEnable</span> is called right after extension was loaded by AdvancedNMotd and <span class="code-part">onExtensionDisable</span> is called right before extension is unloaded.<br/><br/>
				This is how you begin:<br/><br/>
				<img class="code" src="images/docs/prepareExtension/step1.png" alt=" Preparing extension. Step 1."/><br/><br/>
				Thirdly, you need to create <span class="code-part">passport.yml</span> file where provide basic information about extension that will be accessed by <span class="code-part">AdvancedNMotd</span> when it loads it. A good analogy would be a creation of <span class="code-part">plugin.yml</span> file when developing a plugin for the <span class="code-part">Spigot</span> server.<br/><br/>
				The <span class="code-part">passport.yml</span> file is created in <span class="code-part">src</span> folder and looks like:<br/><br/>
				<img class="code" src="images/docs/prepareExtension/step2.png" alt=" Preparing extension. Step 2."/><br/><br/>
				Where in <span class="code-part">main</span> section is presented path to main class we created. Note, that <span class="code-part">every</span> field of <span class="code-part">passport.yml</span> file must be written in it. Otherwise, <span class="code-part">AdvancedNMotd</span> will throw an exception.<br/><br/>
				Congratulations! You have successfully prepared extension that can be loaded by <span class="code-part">AdvancedNMotd</span>. Every extension must be located in <span class="code-part">AdvancedNMotd/extensions</span> folder.<br/><br/>
				If you did everything right, you should see the following output in the console:<br/><br/>
				<img style="filter: invert(0);" class="code" src="images/docs/prepareExtension/step3.png" alt=" Preparing extension. Step 3."/><br/><br/>
				<sub>If you don't know how to create a project or how to build jar file, please, use Google. There are a lot of videos about it.</sub>
